# Rosetta Code Projects
___
A collection of simple tasks performed in various languages, these projects come from http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks .

The point of this repository is simply to keep track of all the projects from it I have done, and is primarily just training exercises and also helps me become accumstomed to new languages by associating similarities between languages I already know and the newer language I am learning.
